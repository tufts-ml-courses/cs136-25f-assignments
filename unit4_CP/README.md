# Data Analysis Task

Can we group the images of shirts/tops/pullovers from FashionMNIST into coherent clusters?


# Outline

In problem 1, you implement EM for GMM training

In problem 2 (optional), you implement L-BFGS gradient descent for GMM training


# Install

You'll use the standard environment for CS136 in 2025:

<https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/136/2025f/setup_python_env.html>


# Usage

To verify your starter code, you can run

1) python train_EM_gmm_with_many_runs.py

2)  python plot_history_for_many_runs.py
